# Productivity

Final project for a backend course, this project is a web application which provides the user the possibility to
track the time they use on a given project.

User can create projects, and add tasks to these projects. When they start working on
a task, they can start the timer for that task. This gives the user the ability to
know how much they are using for different things on a given day.

Data for all the projects is saved in cloud, and the user can view their time usage
for each project.

## Running the project

1. Clone project
2. In ~/server:

- run npm i
- create .env in root, add mongodb url to it
  DB_URL=mongodb://credentials@host
- run server with command: npm run build:dev

3. In ~/client:

- run npm i
- run npm run start

### Server queries/mutations

#### #Accounts

- mutation {
  registerUser(credentials: {
  username: "@",
  password: "@"
  }) {
  \_id
  username
  creationDate
  }

- query {
  login(credentials: {
  username: "@",
  password: "@"
  }) {
  \_id
  username
  creationDate
  token
  }
  }

### A few notes to self if revisiting the project

- Contains unefficient solutions for alot of things. For example, state management in client app is
  done with hooks, and most of them were scoped to pages. This lead to a few issues with the UI not
  being kept up to date on all data, and a bandaid fix has been implemented to handle these cases.
  (see contextWrapper.tsx)

- Client side queries could be optimized (+ used in refresh queries with new state management).

- Improvements should be done on the server side as well (moving the data management
  out of graphql services, bugfixes, proper deletion of stuff, proper input validation).
